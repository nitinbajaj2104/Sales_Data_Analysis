## Recommendations

1. Optimize Deal Size Strategy:
   
Given that revenue is highest in medium deal size products, consider optimizing the pricing and marketing strategies for these products. Additionally, evaluate the performance of large deal size products to identify areas for improvement or consider adjusting the product mix to focus on more profitable offerings.

2. Evaluate Performance of non performing products:
   
The business can evaluate the performance of the products which account for the lowest share in the total sales like planes to identify areas for improvment and look whether any opportunity arises to increase its sales . For example if required the business can make some modifications or changes in the marketing techniques , quality of components of the plane , if required ,to attract more customers.

3. Focus on High-Performing Markets:
   
Given that sales are highest in the USA and lowest in Ireland, concentrate marketing efforts and resources on the high-performing markets. Consider tailoring promotions, advertising, and product offerings to better suit the preferences and needs of customers in these regions.

4. Customer Engagement and Loyalty Programs:
   
Implement customer engagement and loyalty programs , especially in countries where sales are lowest like Ireland and Philippines to encourage repeat business. Offering discounts, exclusive promotions, or rewards for frequent purchases can help build customer loyalty and increase overall sales.


5. Seasonal Marketing and Inventory Planning:
   
Since November consistently shows the highest revenue, plan marketing campaigns and inventory levels to capitalize on this trend. Adjust promotions, discounts, and advertising to maximize sales during peak months. Similarly, consider optimizing inventory and operations during slower months to minimize costs.
